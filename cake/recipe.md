Oreo Cheesecake
Using an electric mixer, beat together cream cheese and sugar until creamy and well-combined.
Stir in sour cream and vanilla extract.
Add eggs, one at a time, stirring until just combined after each addition (you donâ€™t want to over-beat the eggs or the cheesecake will be more likely to crack)
Use a spatula to fold in Oreos.
Pour evenly into springform pan over Oreo crust.
Bake on 350F for 35-45 minutes or until center is set but springs back to the touch.
Once Oreo Cheesecake has finished baking, allow it to cool to room temperature for about an hour before placing in the refrigerator to cool and set completely (about 6 hours). Once cheesecake is cooled, you may prepare the chocolate ganache.
